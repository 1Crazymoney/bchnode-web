  intro:
    parag1: The Bitcoin Cash Node project has been providing high quality full node software for the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network since February 2020.
    parag2: The following are our goals for the short, medium and long term.
  shortterm:
    title: Short term
    goal1: Establish a professional mining node which listens to feedback and delivers measurable improvements.
    goal2: Provide well-researched proposals for consensus rule enhancements regarding DAA, 0-conf and script improvements.
    goal3: Lead by example with specification-driven development that enables greater mining node diversity and increases BCH's resistance to capture.
  mediumterm:
    title: Medium term
    goal1: Demonstrate sustainable client development based on wide ecosystem input and a transparent, voluntary funding model.
    goal2: Strengthen an evidence-based approach to prioritization, decision making and deployment of consensus changes to enable better outcomes and progress toward BCH goals while reducing the risk of a currency split.
    goal3: Make progress on the scaling work for global adoption through performance improvements and more advanced protocols between network peers.
    goal4: Cooperate on specification and testing iniatives to diversify the node landscape, stimulate broader participation and protect the BCH network from catastrophic failures.
  longterm:
    title: Long term
    goal1: Raise awareness of the unique value of BCH's permissionless, decentralized and sound monetary nature so that the ecosystem can use it to accelerate global adoption.
