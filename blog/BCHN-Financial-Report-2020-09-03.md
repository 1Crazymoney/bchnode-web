The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project practices and promotes transparent reporting.

Project funds are held by team members in a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet.

This wallet is used to receive [donations](https://bitcoincashnode.org/#donate) and pay for project expenses (general funding of BCH Node operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting).

All our transactions are on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

We use open source wallet software ([Electron Cash](https://www.electroncash.org/)) and maintain our accounts using [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) in a [ledger file](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/blob/master/finance/bookkeeping/prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk.journal) which is part of the public [project management repository](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public) on GitLab.

Based on this public ledger, the project can account for all its income and expenses and produce financial reports using auditable open source software.

Please refer to the Links section at the bottom for links to previous financial reports.

### Project account details as of 2020-09-03

The statements below cover transactions up to and including on 3 September 2020.

`2144.54018089` BCH was held by the project at the time of writing. This represents an increase in available funds of almost 98% since the previous report in July, even counting in expenses since. This was due to a very generous anonymous donation received in August 2020 (see Income section below for details). Overall this puts the project in a very good financial state.

All expenses below fall within the scope of our funding proposal (link above). Since project start, a total of `189.35026424` BCH has been spent so far, broken down as indicated. About 56% (~105.8 BCH) of the total expense amount has been spent since the [last report](https://read.cash/@bitcoincashnode/bchn-financial-report-2020-07-07-d04c7e65) .

### Income

Currently BCHN derives all its income from donations.

The donations below include those made directly to our project donation address and those forwarded from tips on this site.

</figure>

A total of `2333.89044513` BCH had been received in donations since the start of the project in February 2020\. About half of that was raised via a Flipstarter campaign which [successfully completed](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/newsroom/bchn-flipstarted) on 26 April, yielding `978` BCH in funding for BCHN's initial [project proposal](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/raw/master/finance/funding/campaigns/2020-q2-flipstarter/pdf/Bitcoin_Cash_Node_Flipstarter_Funding_Proposal_v1_1.pdf). Another `1000` BCH was received in an anonymous donation in August 2020 (thank you!)

There are many other anonymous donations making up the remainder, but some of our biggest known donors include ASICseer.com and Marc de Mesel.

We thank all our donors for their support!

### Expenses

Below are the project's expenses since the last overview. The `mining fees` have been excluded. These are the network fees paid by BCHN when transacting on the Bitcoin Cash network, totalling only 0.00018678 BCH or less than 10 US cents for ALL financial transactions conducted by the project in its life up to now!

In the last two months since the last report, BCHN activity was focused intensely on resolving the DAA replacement specification and implementation ahead of the August 15 feature freeze for November. The DAA replacement task was concluded in August with the ASERT algorithm being scheduled for November 2020 deployment.

DAA review/development related payments were made at the beginning of September, at the end of that development task.

Further, two code review bounties were awarded in August for reviews of the ASERT implementation in BCHN.

Backport related work comprised the second largest expense during the last two months, with translation and public relations costs making up the remaining expenses.

### Basic statistics about BCHN project ledger

These are derived from hledger tool's statistic report.

### Notes about balances displayed on block explorers

Block explorers may show a slightly lower amount for the main wallet address `prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk` (2,144.53942266 BCH at block 651,190).

This is because a small amount in donations (currently 0.00075823 BCH) are stored on a subsequent address (`pp03e95qz7yene7v4vdx2vfsqx4qsq4wfvw8z3pkjf`) in BCHN's multi-signature wallet which was issued to Coin.dance who are collecting donations on behalf of node client projects. They requested this separate address for their own accounting purposes. BCHN will probably periodically receive some donations coming in from there - should significant amounts accrue, they will eventually be moved to the main wallet, but the report (as above) will reflect the total donated amounts on both our main and this secondary address.

### SLP donation address

The project has a SimpleLedger (SLP) token donation address.

`simpleledger:qrjv4klcn9z5kqeye3ps64pr6aa4mzux8cy776pm6k`

Currently, the project has received and is holding a donation of 2,000,000 SPICE üå∂Ô∏è on that address.

A few other unknown tokens have been sent to the address.

As we conduct our payments exclusively in Bitcoin Cash up to now, we have yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way, as this would be a way to spam the project.

### Development bounties

The project has had good experience with bountied work so far and plans to increase that share of its expenditure.

Developers who are interested in partaking in upcoming bounties, are invited to join the project Slack (link below) for announcements in the development channels and [keep an eye out for Issues on GitLab marked with a](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=bounty) `bounty` [label](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=bounty).
