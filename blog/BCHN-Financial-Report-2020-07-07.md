The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project practices and promotes transparent reporting.

Project funds are held by team members in a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet.

This wallet is used to receive [donations](https://bitcoincashnode.org/#donate) and pay for project expenses (general funding of BCH Node operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting).

All our transactions are on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

We use open source wallet software ([Electron Cash](https://www.electroncash.org/)) and maintain our accounts using [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) in a [ledger file](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/blob/master/finance/bookkeeping/prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk.journal) which is part of the public [project management repository](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public) on GitLab.

Based on this public ledger, the project can account for all its income and expenses and produce financial reports using auditable open source software.

### Project account details as of 2020-07-06

The statements below cover transactions up to and including on 6 July 2020.

A total of 1167.32876742 BCH had been received in donations, most of that via the Flipstarter campaign which [successfully completed](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/newsroom/bchn-flipstarted) on 26 April, yielding 978 BCH in funding for BCHN's initial [project proposal](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/raw/master/finance/funding/campaigns/2020-q2-flipstarter/pdf/Bitcoin_Cash_Node_Flipstarter_Funding_Proposal_v1_1.pdf).

All expenses below fall within the scope of our funding proposal (link above). Since project start, a total of 83.53292538 BCH has been spent so far, broken down as indicated. About 55% of that total amount has been spent since the last reporting period (see Expenses section for breakdown).

1083.79584204 BCH was held by the project at the time of writing.

We thank all our donors for their support!

### Expenses

Below are the project's expenses since the last overview. The `mining fees` have been excluded (they are the network fees paid by BCHN when transacting on the Bitcoin Cash network - around 516 to 616 satoshis per transaction during this time.)

        2020/06/30  ex:development:backporting    27.54447756 BCH

The flipstarter payment constitutes the second (final) payment for development of [easy deployment](https://read.cash/@flipstarter/flipstarter-next-step-easy-to-deploy-same-user-experience-9fd8a8c1) functionality by Corentin Mercier.

No review bounties were paid in June.

Backport related work comprised the majority of expenses.

#### Notes about balances displayed on block explorers

Block explorers may show a slightly lower amount for the main wallet address `prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk` (1,083.79508381 BCH at block 642,846).

This is because a small amount in donations (currently 0.00075823 BCH) are stored on a subsequent address (`pp03e95qz7yene7v4vdx2vfsqx4qsq4wfvw8z3pkjf`) in BCHN's multi-signature wallet which was issued to Coin.dance who are collecting donations on behalf of node client projects. They requested this separate address for their own accounting purposes. BCHN will probably periodically receive some donations coming in from there - should significant amounts accrue, they will eventually be moved to the main wallet, but the report (as above) will reflect the total donated amounts on both our main and this secondary address.

### SLP donation address

The project has a [SimpleLedger (SLP)](https://simpleledger.cash) token donation address.

`simpleledger:qrjv4klcn9z5kqeye3ps64pr6aa4mzux8cy776pm6k`

Currently, the project has received and is holding a donation of 2,000,000 SPICE üå∂Ô∏è on that address.

As we plan to conduct our payments in Bitcoin Cash, we have yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way, as this would be a way to spam the project.
