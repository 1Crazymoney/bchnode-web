<% set('title', 'BCHN Survey of Chinese Ecosystem about DAA Change in November') %>
<% set('date', '12 July 2020') %>
<% set('author', 'Bitcoin Cash Node Team') %>

Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) Representative [Tracy Chen](BCHN-welcomes-Tracy-Chen-as-Representative) consulted with the Chinese Bitcoin Cash community (big mining pools, exchanges, key persons and holders) on the question of whether they support a change of Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) in November.

The question was "_Do you think DAA should be resolved in the November upgrade?_" We stress that this was an opinion poll and not a binding vote.

The results were as follows:

### <u>Mining pools</u>

3 out of 5 in agreement to modify the DAA. The other 2 were neutral.
