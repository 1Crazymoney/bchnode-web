This is a FAQ specifically on BCHN's position regarding the November 2020 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade and related topics.

It is a document that is expected to incur some revision as we learn about new questions that the ecosystem may have. Please feel free to leave your questions in the comments.

* * *

### 1. What proposal is BCHN backing for November, if any?

BCHN backs the deployment of the aserti3-2d ([ASERT](https://read.cash/@jtoomim/bch-upgrade-proposal-use-asert-as-the-new-daa-8887b9c1)) difficulty algorithm of Mark Lundeberg and Jonathan Toomim for the November upgrade.

### 2. Would you consider a "no-upgrade" for November?

No, we do not support a "no upgrade" for November as we see the correction of the current DAA's problems as critical for the survival of Bitcoin Cash. The ASERT proposal has been evaluated against a wide range of contenders, including the recently announced Grasberg proposal, and has demonstrably outperformed them.

### 3. Does BCHN support the creation of a new coin (i.e. a currency split)?

No. We support a unified Bitcoin Cash ecosystem moving forward on the basis of a well-researched, tested proposal that performs measurably better than the alternatives.

### 4. Is BCHN going to abolish Automatic Replay Protection (aka poison pill)?

The intent of "Automatic Replay Protection" is to avoid un-upgraded nodes causing problems after a planned upgrade. It causes un-upgraded nodes to fork themselves off to a new network at the time of an upgrade.

BCHN has a better way to accomplish the same intent by first ensuring that un-upgraded nodes notify the operator ahead of time, and second simply halting the un-upgraded node at the upgrade. Notification and shutdown are more actionable and save the operator the wasted time and money of mining or accidentally transacting on an empty chain.

### 5. Has anyone asked BCHN to implement historic drift correction?

No. Despite being in contact with pools, exchanges and many other businesses that use and build on Bitcoin Cash, no-one has ever asked BCHN for this feature.

Moreover, the implications (longer block times & reduced mining reward) as recently considered byÂ the ecosystem have shown strong and wide opposition to such a feature which negatively affects many users and would harm the reputation of the network.
